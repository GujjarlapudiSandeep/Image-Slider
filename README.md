## How to Run
1. **Download the Project:**
   - Clone or download the project files from the repository.

2. **File Structure:**
   Ensure that the following files are present in the project folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - Image files (`image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`, `image4.jpg`, `image5.jpg`)

3. **Open in a Browser:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## Usage
- **Navigation:**
  - Click the "Previous" (`<`) button to view the previous image.
  - Click the "Next" (`>`) button to view the next image.

## Customization
- To change the images, replace the source (`src`) attributes of the `<img>` tags in `index.html` with the paths to your preferred images.
- You can adjust the slideshow interval in `index.js` by modifying the `setInterval` duration (currently set to 3000 milliseconds).
